# Lost In The Dark

## Overwiew

This is a top-down game for my CSCI319 class, where your character is a torch that will use light to find its way on different levels.


## Requirements

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## things to add 

- including a inventory or tools / usables for the torch in order to go through the levels

- make it harder with enemies as things move on.

- enemies regenerate health after a certain amount of time. maybe include or change something about this and think about the idea of regenerating or loosing health depending on the state (low , medium , high) from the flame itself || object will have to overlap the radius, on any place


- maybe changing the health status from static to progressive, the most light used the more damage you recieve and vice-versa, since now its static, if you increase there is a static rate

# Lost In The Dark

## Overwiew

This is a top-down game for my CSCI319 class, where your character is a torch that will use light to find its way on different levels.

## things to add 

- including a inventory or tools / usables for the torch in order to go through the levels

- make it harder with enemies as things move on.


- maybe changing the health status from static to progressive, the most light used the more damage you recieve and vice-versa, since now its static, if you increase there is a static rate
